## Getting started

### VSCode typings

If you use VSCode, we recommend you to install [Lua Language Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) which will allow you to benefit of autocompletion and many other advantages.

As the Lua Language Server extension [no longer supports single workspace](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-lingual-server/discussions/3030), you need to open the workspace multiroot to take advantage of typing. Open `gamemode.code-workspace` in VSCode and click on **Open Workspace**.

- Annotations documentation is available here: https://luals.github.io/wiki/annotations/

## Contributing

We're always looking for new contributors, so if you have any ideas or suggestions, please let us know and we'll see what we can do to make it better. You can either reach us at our Discord server [MafiaHub](https://discord.gg/c6gW9yRXZH), or by raising an issue on our repository.

If you're interested in development, please read our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/MafiaHub/Framework/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## License

The code is licensed under the [MafiaHub OSS](LICENSE.txt) license.

The 5th clause exists to ensure that the work can focus primarily on this repository, as we provide an access to the multiplayer mod. This is important to ensure that the mod is not used for other purposes, such as the creation of other derivative projects, that would diverge from the original work. This approach guarantees that the changes are directly made to the original work itself, having a healthy ecosystem in mind.
